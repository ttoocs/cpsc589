(10 marks) The first quadratic B-spline basis function defining on positive integer numbers (knot sequence) is given as: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that N_{0,3} (u) is really a third order spline function (verify the necessary properties only at u = 0). \\

At $N_{0,3}$, we must show that it is continious, and hence a spline function: \\
At $u=0$:
$C^0 : 0 = u^2/2 \to  0  = 0$
$C^1 : 0 = u^2/2 \to  0  = 0$
$C^2 : 0 = u \to 0 = 0$
$C^3 : 0 = 0 \to 0 = 0$

Hence, it has $c^3$ continuity at $u=0$, which is all that was requested. \\

\item Determine $N_{5,3} (u)$ (try to use $N+{0,3} (u)$). Show your work. \\
As the above equation is for the uniform-knot sequence, and there isn't any reason to assume it is not uniform, we can $N_{i,3}(u) = N_{0,3}(u-i)$. Which gives us: \\
$N_{5,3}(u) = N_{0,3}(u - 5)$ \\
\end{enumerate}
