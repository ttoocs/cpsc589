a)% no ideas.
% You can tell how smooth based on hwen eigen values start to repeat. (two or more)
% so for quadratic 1/2 1/4 1/4 (only two spots, then rest are same)
% so for cubic 1 1/2 1/4 1/8  1/8 (three spots?
% so 1 1/2 1/6... so not as smooth
You can tell how smooth it is based on when the eigen values start repeating: \\
Where quadratic is $1/2, 1/4, 1/4$ \\
and cubic is $1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8$ \\
Hence, this provided filiter is less-smooth than cubic, and smoother than quadratic. \\
b)
Yes, all weights of the filter are sum-to-one in a row \\
