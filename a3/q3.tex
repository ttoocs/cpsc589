% You can tell how smooth based on hwen eigen values start to repeat. (two or more)
% so for quadratic 1/2 1/4 1/4 (only two spots, then rest are same)
% so for cubic 1 1/2 1/4 1/8  1/8 (three spots?
% so 1 1/2 1/6... so not as smooth
(20 marks) Consider the following local subdivision matrix for a new subdivision scheme (a modification.. \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compare the smoothness of this scheme with the cubic B-spline subdivision scheme. \\
You can tell how smooth it is based on when the eigen values start repeating: \\
Where quadratic is $1/2, 1/4, 1/4$ \\
and cubic is $1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8$ \\
Hence, this provided filiter is less-smooth than cubic, and smoother than quadratic. \\
\item Is the resulting curve“coordinate free”? Justify your answer. \\
Yes, all weights of the filter are sum-to-one in any given row, which is a suffishent condition for convex-hull. \\
\end{enumerate}
