(10 marks) Show that Loop subdivision has the strong convex hull property. \\

To show this, we need only to show that all weights on any verticies are non-negative. \\
For each edge weighting:\\ 
$e^{i+1} = \frac{3}{8}v_1^i + \frac{3}{8} v_2^i + \frac{1}{8} v_3^i + \frac{1}{8} v_4^i$ \\
Clearly, each component is non-negative. (and is sum to 1)\\
For each vertix weighting: \\
$v^{i+1} = (1 - n \alpha )v^i + \alpha \sum v^i_j $ \\
Where $\alpha = \frac{1}{n} ( \frac{5}{8} - ( \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} \cos \frac{2 \pi }{n})^2 )$ \\
is always positive as the innter term: $( \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} \cos \frac{2 \pi }{n})^2 )$ is always between $[0,1]$.
