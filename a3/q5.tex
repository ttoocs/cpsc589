(10 marks) Show that Loop subdivision has the strong convex hull property. \\

To show this, we need only to show that all weights on all vertices are non-negative. \\
For each edge weighting:\\ 
$e^{i+1} = \frac{3}{8}v_1^i + \frac{3}{8} v_2^i + \frac{1}{8} v_3^i + \frac{1}{8} v_4^i$ \\
Clearly, each component is non-negative. (and is sum to 1)\\
For each vertex weighting: \\
$v^{i+1} = (1 - n \alpha )v^i + \alpha \sum v^i_j $ \\
Where $\alpha = \frac{1}{n} ( \frac{5}{8} - ( \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} \cos \frac{2 \pi }{n})^2 )$ \\
%is always positive as the innter term: $( \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} \cos \frac{2 \pi }{n})^2 )$ is always between $[0,1]$, and hence never negative.
Here, cos will return [-1,1], and hence, the largest value of the inner term is $1/2$, squared is $1/4$. \\
Giving $\alpha = \frac{1}{n} ( \frac{5}{8} - \frac{1}{4} )$ or $\alpha = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{4}$. \\
Which, is always positive, as $n$ is always positive, and at max size: $\frac{1}{4 n}$ \\
So $v^{i+1} = (1 - n \alpha)v^i + \alpha \sum v^i_j$  has the coefficients of $1-\frac{1}{4} , \frac{1}{4n}$  \\
And hence, it's coefficients are always positive. \\
Hence, it has convex hull property.
