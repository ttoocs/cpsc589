a) No - mobious strip, has only a single side, that is apprent on both 'sides' of the object.

b)
As we are aware a generalized cone is a subset of a ruled surface, and as is generalized cylinder, if we show that a coon can represent a given ruled surface, we have shown it can make generalized cones/cylinders.

A ruled surfance is paramterized as follows: $Q(u,v) = (1 - v)P_0(u) + vP_1(u)$. \\
Where as a Coons Patch can be expressed as: $Q(u, v) =$ \\
$[Q_0 (v)(1 - u) + Q_1 (v)u]$ (the first ruled surface) \\
$+ [P_0 (u)(1 - v) + P_1 (u)v]$ (the second ruled surface) \\
$- [(1 - u)(1 - v)P_{00} + u(1 - v)P_{01} + (1 - u)vP_{10} + uvP_{11} ]$ (The bilinear patch) \\

If we define $P_0(u) = (1-u)P_{00} + uP_{01}$ \\
If we define $P_1(u) = (1-u)P_{10} + uP_{11}$ \\
we get: \\
$Q_o(v)(1u) + Q_1(v)(u)$ \\
\begin{align*}
[P_0 (u)(1 - v) + P_1 (u)v] &= \\
&= (1-v)((1-u)P_{00} + uP_{01}) + v((1-u)P_{10} + uP_{11}) \\
&= [(1 - u)(1 - v)P_{00} + u(1 - v)P_{01} + (1 - u)vP_{10} + uvP_{11} ]
\end{align*}
Which is what is being subtracted as the last term/bilinear patch.

c) What is filter?
